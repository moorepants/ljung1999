I'm going through Ljung's 1999 book on system identification and writing the
algorithms in iPython notebooks. I'll primiarly use Python but may throw in
some R or C for good measure too. After I've got a solid grasp of a lot of the
material, I hope to write a system identifcation toolbox in Python based on the
SciPy stack.
